## 📖 Abstract
Ambient lighting normalization is an important computer vision task that aims to remove shadows and standardize illumination across an entire image. While previous approaches have primarily focused on image restoration and frequency-based cues, this paper hypothesizes that incorporating image geometry can significantly improve the normalization process. We propose PromptNorm, a novel transformer-based model that leverages state-of-the-art monocular depth estimators to overcome the challenges posed by strong shadows and extreme color distortions. Our approach uniquely utilizes image normals as a guiding mechanism. We encode these normals to generate a low-level geometric representation, which is then used as Query inputs to weight the attention maps within transformer blocks dynamically.
Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that PromptNorm not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in ambient lighting normalization but also validates the effectiveness of integrating geometric information into image processing techniques. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments confirm the effectiveness of our method.

## 📊 Dataset
We use the [Ambient6K dataset](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-72897-6_22). To download all the images please check the [official repository](https://github.com/fvasluianu97/IFBlend). We also use [Depth Anything V2](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/26cfdcd8fe6fd75cc53e92963a656c58-Abstract-Conference.html) to generate depth maps and the consequent surface normals. You can download the ambient6k dataset with depth maps and surface normals [here](aaaa). Alternatively, you can check the Depth Anythig V2 [official repository](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2) to generate them and the ```utils/depth_to_normal.py``` to generate the normal maps. Then, the dataset should be structured with the following structure:

```
ambient6k
|-- train
|   |-- input
|   |   |-- 0_input.png
|   |   |-- 1_input.png
|   |   ...
|   |-- normals
|   |   |-- 0_normal.png
|   |   |-- 1_normal.png
|   |   ...
|   |-- target
|   |   |-- 0_gt.png
|   |   |-- 1_gt.png
|   |   ...
|
|-- test
    ...
```

## 🏋️ Training
Modify the configurations of the ```options.py``` file and run the following command:

```
python train.py
```

## 🚀 Inference
Fist, download the pretraind model [here](https://github.com/davidserra9/promptnorm/releases/download/v1.0/promptnorm.ckpt) and place it in the ```pretrained_ckpt``` folder.

Again, modify the configurations of the ```options.py``` file and run the following command:

```
python test.py
```
This script takes all the image in the ambient6k test folder and saves the outputs in ```output_path```.
